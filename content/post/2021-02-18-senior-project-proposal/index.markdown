# Project Background

I would like to perform an exploratory data analysis on student data provided by BYU-Idaho Peer-Success Mentoring. They provide short-term mentoring to a variety of BYU-Idaho student populations with a goal to improve student success and retention. Weâ€™re interested in looking for possible correlation between participation in mentoring and various measures of student success, such as improved GPA.
