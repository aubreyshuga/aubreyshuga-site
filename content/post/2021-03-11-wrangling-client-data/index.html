<p>I’m currently working on a <a href="https://aubreyshuga.netlify.app/category/senior-project/">project</a> with data provided by BYU-Idaho Peer-Success Mentoring. Luckily, the provided data was already mostly in the format that I need for my project. However, no project is complete without at least some data wrangling.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll go through all of the steps I took to wrangle the data - from reading in the raw data to my final <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html">tidy</a> dataset. I’ll be using using the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse package</a>, specifically <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> for data manipulation and <a href="https://readxl.tidyverse.org/">readxl</a> for reading in data from an excel workbook.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load packages
library(dplyr) #for data wrangling
library(readxl) #to read in .xls and .xlsx sheets.
library(pander) #to print tables in markdown
library(tidyverse) #includes dplyr, readxl, and other packages that are in the tidyverse core</code></pre>

<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>BYU-Idaho Peer-Success Mentoring provides short-term mentoring to a variety of BYU-Idaho student populations with a goal to improve student success and retention. We’re interested in looking for possible correlation between participation in mentoring and defined measures of student success, including improved GPA.</p>
<p>The project will be focused on answering the following question: <strong>Do students who participate in Peer-Success Mentoring have more success (improvement in GPA) than students who don’t participate in Peer-Success Mentoring?</strong></p>
<p>This question will be explored through various forms of data analysis, hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics, using data about students who met defined mentoring criteria. A Control group of students who met the criteria but did not participate in mentoring will be compared with a Mentored group of students who met the same criteria and did participate in mentoring. Click <a href="https://aubreyshuga.netlify.app/post/senior-project-proposal/">here</a> to read more about Peer-Success Mentoring and the background for this project.</p>

<div id="provided-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Provided Data</h2>
<p>The data is stored in an excel workbook, where each tab represents a different group of potential mentee.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Control</strong> (Students who met <a href="javascript:myFunction('StudentType')">Tier 3</a> mentoring criteria but opted out of mentoring)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mentored</strong> (Students who met Tier 3 mentoring criteria and participated in mentoring)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Referrals</strong> (Students who were referred to the mentoring program by a faculty member)</p></li>
</ol>
<style>

}
</style>
<div id="StudentType">
<div id="tier-3" class="section level4">
<h4>Tier 3</h4>
<p>Most students in the provided data are classified as “Tier 3”. These students were all offered mentoring and either participated or did not participate, so they are assigned into either the Mentored or Control group.
Tier 3 can be defined by following: “The third tier category focuses on freshmen, in particular any freshman with a 2.0 GPA or lower after their second semester. These students are referred to the [Peer-Success] Mentoring program, where they receive a personal student mentor’s help in addition to their academic advisor.” <a href="https://www.byui.edu/newsroom/news-and-notes/archive/3-25-19-struggling-students">source</a></p>
</div>
<div id="referral" class="section level4">
<h4>Referral</h4>
<p>A smaller number of students in this data are classified as “Referral”. These students were referred to Peer-Success Mentoring by a professor, friend, faculty member, or other person, or they signed up for mentoring on their own accord. These students do not necessarily meet the Tier 3 criteria, so the impact of mentoring might be different.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:myFunction('StudentType')">Click to hide definitions</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>(Note: Mentored and Referrals are both made up of students who did participate in mentoring, so we will actually only have two groups: Control and Mentored.)</p>
<p>Each tab in the workbook follows the same format, where each row is one student with the following columns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>Semester Mentored</code> : Semester they participated in (or opted out of) mentoring (i.e. Fall 2018)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Mentee Name</code>: Student’s name (Lastname, Firstname)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Status</code> : Mentoring <a href="javascript:myFunction('Status')">Status</a> (Active Mentoring, Dropped, Fulfilled Program, or Referred to HJG/LS)</p></li>
</ol>
<style>
#Status {
display: none;
background-color: ghostwhite;

}
</style>
<div id="Status">
<div id="status-definitions" class="section level3">
<h3>Status Definitions</h3>
<p>Every student that meets mentoring criteria is assigned a “status” that describes where the student is at in the mentoring process. Their mentor adjusts this status as the student moves through the process. In this project, each student’s status is the status they were marked as at the end of their mentoring semester. The following statuses are included in this project:</p>
<div id="attempted" class="section level4">
<h4>Attempted</h4>
<p>Students classified as “Attempted” are students who met Tier 3 criteria and were contacted by a Peer-Success Mentor but did not participate in mentoring. They could have declined mentoring or could have not responded to the mentor’s contact attempts. These students are all in the control group.</p>
</div>
<div id="fulfilled-program" class="section level4">
<h4>Fulfilled Program</h4>
<p>These students completed the 3-4 mentoring sessions in the program.</p>
</div>
<div id="dropped" class="section level4">
<h4>Dropped</h4>
<p>These students were dropped from the mentoring program for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They attended one or more mentoring sessions and informed the mentor that they wanted to discontinue mentoring.</p></li>
<li><p>They attended one or more mentoring sessions but no-showed for their remaining sessions without communicating to the mentor that they wanted to discontinue mentoring</p></li>
<li><p>They enrolled in mentoring but no-showed for their first session without communicating to the mentor that they wanted to discontinue mentoring</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="referred-to-hjgls" class="section level4">
<h4>Referred to HJG/LS</h4>
<p>These students were referred to other peer-mentoring programs, including Heber J. Grant Mentoring and Life-Skills Mentoring. These students could have met with a Peer-Success Mentor one or more times before being referred to another program, or they could have been referred without meeting with a Peer-Success Mentor.</p>
</div>
<div id="active-mentoring" class="section level4">
<h4>Active Mentoring</h4>
<p>These students enrolled in Peer-Success Mentoring, but for some reason were never marked as “Fulfilled Program”. This could be due to a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The student signed up for mentoring, but never attended any of their sessions</p></li>
<li><p>They attended one or more mentoring sessions but then “no-showed” for their remaining sessions without communicating to the mentor that they wanted to discontinue mentoring</p></li>
<li><p>The student actively participated in mentoring, but enrolled too late in the semester to complete enough sessions to be marked as “fulfilled” (Each semester, the mentors start over with a new list of Tier 3 students)</p></li>
<li><p>The student was moved to another status (Fulfilled, Dropped, Referred to HJG/LS), but the mentor forgot to change the student’s status in the records.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, it is hard to know the experience that these students had. They probably do not all belong in the same group.</p>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>I-Number</code> : Student’s unique ID number</p></li>
<li><p><code>Student Type</code> : Mentoring criteria that student falls under (Tier 3 or Referral)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Pre 1</code> : Student’s GPA the semester before the semester mentored</p></li>
<li><p><code>Semester Mentored</code> : Student’s GPA the semester mentored</p></li>
<li><p><code>Post 1</code> : Student’s GPA the semester after the semester mentored</p></li>
<li><p><code>Post 2</code> : Student’s GPA 2 semesters after the semester mentored</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Even before reading in the data, I noticed some changes that needed to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two columns have the same name, “Semester Mentored”.</li>
<li>There are 3 tabs, but there are really two overlapping sets of two groups: Control vs Mentored and Tier 3 vs Referral. The three tabs don’t group the students in the way we need.</li>
<li>This data includes student identifiers, such as their name and their student ID number, which need to be removed for privacy reasons.</li>
<li>Some rows are completely blank.</li>
<li>The column names contain spaces, which will make referencing them harder.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="read-in-the-data-using-read_excel" class="section level2">
<h2>Read in the Data using read_excel</h2>

<p>(For the sake of this post, I created fabricated data in the same format as the real data).</p>
</div>
<div id="combine-the-3-datasets" class="section level2">
<h2>Combine the 3 Datasets</h2>
<p>Because the three groups overlap a bit, let’s add a new column to specify whether that student is Mentored or Control. I used the <code>mutate()</code> function from the dplyr package for this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Add a column to specify which group that student belongs to.
Mentored &lt;- Mentored %&gt;%
  mutate(&quot;Group&quot; = &quot;Mentored&quot;)

Control &lt;- Control %&gt;%
  mutate(&quot;Group&quot; = &quot;Control&quot;)

Referrals &lt;- Referrals %&gt;%
  mutate(&quot;Group&quot; = &quot;Mentored&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now that all three datasets have a <code>Group</code> column, let’s combine them into one dataframe using <code>rbind()</code> function. While we’re at it, let’s also rename the columns to make things a bit easier going forward.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Combine both groups into one dataframe
Students &lt;- rbind(Mentored, Control, Referrals) %&gt;%
  
  #rename some columns
  rename(semester_mentored = `Semester Mentored...1`,
         `Pre_1` = `Pre 1`, 
         `During` = `Semester Mentored...7`, 
         `Post_1` = `Post 1`, 
         `Post_2` = `Post 2`,
        `Student_Type` = `Student Type`)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need to remove the rows that have no data in them. The main reason for doing this is that later on, I’ll want to count how many NA’s are in each column. If there are complete rows of NA, that will mess with those counts. The full NA rows shouldn’t be in there at all. To make sure we remove rows that have no student data at all, we’ll check for rows where the name is “NA” and remove those. Then we know for sure that we didn’t accidentally remove a student who is in the data, but is missing a GPA in some semesters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Remove rows that do not have any actual mentee info
Students &lt;- Students %&gt;%
  filter(`Mentee Name` != &quot;NA&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s what the dataset looks like so far:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Show row 1, 30, and 50 (for a variety of different types of mentees)
Students[c(1,30, 50),] %&gt;% pander()</code></pre>

I also used <code>mutate()</code> to make a new column with the text for the label, using the value that we just added on. After that, I no longer need the sample size dataframes, so I removed them from my environment.</p>

<p>The tidy-est version of our data will be the “long” format. Pre_1, During, Post_1, and Post_2 could be considered variables, but they are really values for the variable semester.

<ul>
<li><p><code>semester_mentored</code> : Semester they participated in (or opted out of) mentoring (i.e. Fall 2018)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Status</code> : Mentoring Status (Attempted, Active Mentoring, Dropped, Fulfilled Program, or Referred to HJG/LS)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Student Type</code> : Mentoring criteria that student falls under (Tier 3 or Referral)</p></li>
