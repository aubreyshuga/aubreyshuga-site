# Intro

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

[blogpost](https://github.com/sarahsauve/TidyTuesdays/blob/master/BFFPDashboard/BlogPost.md)

[Challenge intro](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/readme.md)

[data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv)

[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)


# The Data

Tidy Tuesday provides the following code to load in the data:

```r
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-01-26')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 5)

plastics <- tuesdata$plastics

# Or read in the data manually

plastics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv')

```

Since there are a few options, I decided to use the tidytuesdayR package option. That way, I can work with any other Tidy Tuesday data without having to find the link. I just need to know the week number.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 5) #load in this week's data
```

`tuesdata` is a list where the first item is our dataframe, so we'll need to extract the plastics item from the list and save it.

```{r}
#plastics <- tuesdata$plastics #grab the plastics item from the list and save it as plastics (this is our data)
```

Note: I ended up having to use the other option sometimes when I had too many github requests
```{r echo=TRUE}
plastics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv')
```

If we peek at the data, it looks like each row is a `country`-`year`-`parent_company` combination. This data only contains 2019 and 2020.

```{r}
plastics %>% head() %>% knitr::kable()
```

Tidy Tuesday also provides a Data Dictionary that explains each column in the dataset:

### Data Dictionary

The plastic is categorized by [recycling codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling_codes).

`plastics.csv`

|variable       |class     |description |
|:---|:---|:-----------|
|country        |character |Country of cleanup |
|year           |double    | Year (2019 or 2020) |
|parent_company |character | Source of plastic |
|empty          |double    | Category left empty count |
|hdpe           |double    | High density polyethylene count (Plastic milk containers, plastic bags, bottle caps, trash cans, oil cans, plastic lumber, toolboxes, supplement containers) |
|ldpe           |double    | Low density polyethylene count (Plastic bags, Ziploc bags, buckets, squeeze bottles, plastic tubes, chopping boards) |
|o              |double    | Category marked other count |
|pet            |double    | Polyester plastic count (Polyester fibers, soft drink bottles, food containers (also see plastic bottles) |
|pp             |double    | Polypropylene count (Flower pots, bumpers, car interior trim, industrial fibers, carry-out beverage cups, microwavable food containers, DVD keep cases) |
|ps             |double    | Polystyrene count (Toys, video cassettes, ashtrays, trunks, beverage/food coolers, beer cups, wine and champagne cups, carry-out food containers, Styrofoam) |
|pvc            |double    | PVC plastic count (Window frames, bottles for chemicals, flooring, plumbing pipes) |
|grand_total    |double    | Grand total count (all types of plastic) |
|num_events     |double    | Number of counting events |
|volunteers     |double    | Number of volunteers |


```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#Create a markdown table of column names and types

# tibble(variable = names(plastics)) %>% 
#     mutate(class = map(plastics, typeof)) %>% 
#     knitr::kable()
```

### Data Summary

We can use `skimr::skim()` to see a summary of the data, including the number of rows and columns, column types, and some summary stats for each column.

```{r}
skimr::skim(plastics) #print a summary of the data
```

---

# Data Wrangling

The first step I'd like to take is renaming the columns using the information in the data dictionary. This will help me to remember what each column means.

```{r}
plastics_new <- plastics %>%
  rename("empty_count" = "empty",
         "high_density_polyethylene_count" = "hdpe",
         "low_density_polyethylene_count" = "ldpe",
         "other_count" = "o",
         "polyester_plastic_count" = "pet",
         "polypropylene_count" = "pp",
         "polystyrene_count" = "ps",
         "pvc_plastic_count" = "pvc",
         "total_plastic_count" = "grand_total", #I'm renaming this because there is also a country called "Grand Total" and I don't want to mix them up
         "times_counted" = "num_events")
  
  # #rename some values that are the same but have diff names
  # mutate(parent_company = gsub("estle", "estl√©", parent_company),
  #        parent_company = gsub("PT Mayora Indah Tbk", "Mayora Indah", parent_company),
  #        parent_company = gsub("Pepsico", "PepsiCo", parent_company))


  
  
```

# Viz

I'm interested in which parent companies create the most plastic pollution. Here is the code for my final plot:

```r
#I want to look at the top 10 `parent_company`s with the highest total `total_plastic_count` (of all countries and years)

#Create new dataframe to use for my plot
p_dat <- plastics_new %>% 
  
  #Get total `total_plastic_count` for each company
  group_by(parent_company) %>%
  summarise(total_plastic_count = sum(total_plastic_count)) %>%
  
  #Remove any parent_company where the name isn't actually 1 company 
  filter(!parent_company %in% c("null","NULL","Grand Total","Unbranded", "Assorted")) %>%
  
  #Keep the rows with the top 10 total_plastic_count values
  slice_max(order_by = total_plastic_count, n = 10) %>%
  
  #Turn all " " and "-" into "\n" to fit more on one line
  mutate(parent_company = gsub("Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Producers' Federation Ltd", "Tamil Nadu Co-operative \nMilk Producers' Federation Ltd", parent_company))
  

#Create my plot
p <- p_dat %>%
  ggplot() +
  
  #Add a point for each company's count
  geom_point(aes(y = reorder(parent_company, total_plastic_count),
                 x = total_plastic_count,
                 col = parent_company),
                size = 15) +
  
  #Add a line for each company (lollipop chart)
  geom_segment(aes(y = parent_company,
                   yend = parent_company,
                   x = 0,
                   xend = total_plastic_count,

  #                                                  scales::math_format(10^.x))) +
  
  #Add all my labels
  labs(title = "Top 10 Creators of Plastic Pollutions Worldwide", 
       subtitle = "Out of all cleanup events in 2019 and 2020, these 10 companies had the most plastic items that were made by the company.",
       caption = "Data from breakfreefromplastic.org | Viz by Aubrey Shuga",
       y = "Company",

# Gif

While creating my viz for this week, I saved a copy of each iteration. I now want to create a gif to show how my plot chnaged from my initial stab at it to my final plot. [some steps taken from this tutorial](http://www.nagraj.net/notes/gifs-in-r/)

```r
library(magick)

## list file names in interations folder
imgs <- list.files("iterations", full.names = TRUE)

#For each filename in imgs, read the image and store it in img_list
img_list <- lapply(imgs, image_read)

## join the images together
img_joined <- image_join(img_list)

## animate at 2 frames per second
img_animated <- image_animate(img_joined, fps = 4)

## view animated image
img_animated

## save to disk
image_write(image = img_animated,
            path = "plastic_pollution.gif")
```

![](plastic_pollution.gif)

You can see that I wanted to add more, but I ended up giving up and going back to an earlier iteration.
